Now simply chmod +x the .class, .jar and/or .html files you want to execute.
To add a Java program to your path best put a symbolic link to the main
.class file into /usr/bin (or another place you like) omitting the .class
extension. The directory containing the original .class file will be
added to your CLASSPATH during execution.


To test your new setup, enter in the following simple Java app, and name
it "HelloWorld.java":

	class HelloWorld {
		public static void main(String args[]) {
			System.out.println("Hello World!");
		}
	}

Now compile the application with:
	javac HelloWorld.java

Set the executable permissions of the binary file, with:
	chmod 755 HelloWorld.class

And then execute it:
	./HelloWorld.class


To execute Java Jar files, simple chmod the *.jar files to include
the execution bit, then just do
       ./Application.jar


To execute Java Applets, simple chmod the *.html files to include
the execution bit, then just do
	./Applet.html
