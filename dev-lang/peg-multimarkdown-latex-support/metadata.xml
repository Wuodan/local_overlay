		peg-multimarkdown is a program to convert plain text into HTML or LaTeX. This project includes some default template files that can be used to create certain types of documents using LaTeX.
		
		You are not limited to using these classes or templates. You can create your own template files, or just embed your LaTeX commands within comments in your MultiMarkdown document itself. If you find yourself creating similar documents over and over again, however, you may be better off creating a few templates you can simply call with the LaTeX Input metadata fields in MultiMarkdown.
		
		These files were designed to handle some of the common metadata fields in a consistent way, an to implement some defaults that should prevent errors if you leave out important metadata (substituting Title, Author, etc).
