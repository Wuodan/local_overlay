  Instance of Print Library based on gEfiPrint2ProtocolGuid.

  Implement the print library instance by wrap the interface 
  provided in the Print2 protocol. This protocol is defined as the internal
  protocol related to this implementation, not in the public spec. So, this 
  library instance is only for this code base.

  Converts a decimal value to a Null-terminated ASCII string.
  
  Converts the decimal number specified by Value to a Null-terminated ASCII string 
  specified by Buffer containing at most Width characters. No padding of spaces 
  is ever performed.
  If Width is 0 then a width of  MAXIMUM_VALUE_CHARACTERS is assumed.
  The number of ASCII characters in Buffer is returned not including the Null-terminator.

  characters are returned, and the total number of characters required to perform
  the conversion is returned.
  Additional conversion parameters are specified in Flags.  
  The Flags bit LEFT_JUSTIFY is always ignored.
  All conversions are left justified in Buffer.
  If Width is 0, PREFIX_ZERO is ignored in Flags.
  If COMMA_TYPE is set in Flags, then PREFIX_ZERO is ignored in Flags, and commas
  are inserted every 3rd digit starting from the right.
  If RADIX_HEX is set in Flags, then the output buffer will be 
  formatted in hexadecimal format.
  If Value is < 0 and RADIX_HEX is not set in Flags, then the fist character in Buffer is a '-'.
  If PREFIX_ZERO is set in Flags and PREFIX_ZERO is not being ignored, 
  then Buffer is padded with '0' characters so the combination of the optional '-' 
  sign character, '0' characters, digit characters for Value, and the Null-terminator
  add up to Width characters.
