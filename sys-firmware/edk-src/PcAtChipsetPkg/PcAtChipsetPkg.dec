  ## Pcd8259LegacyModeMask defines the default mask value for platform. This value is determined
  #  1) If platform only support pure UEFI, value should be set to 0xFFFF or 0xFFFE;
  #     Because only clock interrupt is allowed in legacy mode in pure UEFI platform.
  #  2) If platform install CSM and use thunk module:
  #     a) If thunk call provided by CSM binary requires some legacy interrupt support, the corresponding bit 
  #        should be opened as 0.
  #        For example, if keyboard interfaces provided CSM binary use legacy keyboard interrupt in 8259 bit 2, then
  #        the value should be set to 0xFFFC
  #     b) If all thunk call provied by CSM binary do not require legacy interrupt support, value should be set
  #        to 0xFFFF or 0xFFFE.
  #
  #  Because the value is used as intialization value, PCD's type should be FixedAtBuild.
  #
  #  The default value of legacy mode mask could be changed by EFI_LEGACY_8259_PROTOCOL->SetMask(). But it is rarely
  #  need change it except some special cases such as when initializing the CSM binary, it should be set to 0xFFFF to 
  #  mask all legacy interrupt. Please restore the original legacy mask value if changing is made for these special case.
